# what are variables?

# there are different types of variables
# strings are text
name= "John" #quotation marks
name2= "Lucy"
# integers are whole numbers
num1="10" # no quotation marks
num2=20
print(int(num1)+num2)
# when you have a plus sign betrween two variables its called concatenatiom
# floats are decimal numbers
# typecasting is when you convert a variable from one type to another

# f strings allows us to insert variables into strings
# using f before the string
print(f"{name}and {name2} have {num1} apples")
# it can be positivce or negative
dollars= 10.99
print (f"{name} has {dollars} dollars")
# booleans arew true or false
is_student = True
# It can be true or false
print(f" {name} is a student: {is_student}")
# lists are collections of values
# dictionaries are collections of key-values pairs
# problem set #1
# 1. create 5 diff types of variables
# 2. print them out
# 3. use f strings to format the strings

name= "hunty"
